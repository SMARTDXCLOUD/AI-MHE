# AI-MHE
# Using Outcome-Based Meta Machine Learning Approach Towards Predicting Medical Student Status
# introduction:
In various countries, medical students are required to pass a series of medical licensing examinations to graduate with a Doctor of Medicine degree. At the same time, their performance in one of these exams might indicate their future performance in subsequent exams. This study proposes a generic artificial intelligence (AI) methodology, called AI-MHE, that utilizes innovative meta-machine learning (ML) and outcome-based models to accurately and reliably predict the performance of medical students in comprehensive medical licensing examinations. 
This methodology aims to provide insights into the early prediction of students' performance and identify at-risk students in current and future medical licensing exams.
# Conclusion: 
AI-MHE has demonstrated the potential of outcome-based meta-ML models as an accurate and reliable substitute for medical licensing examinations. Our models provided insights for students and educators by early identifying at-risk students and determining the specific courses that require personal focus during their education. Additionally, they can assist policy-makers in developing targeted interventions to enhance medical students' academic performance, ultimately leading to overall improvements in medical licensing exam outcomes.
